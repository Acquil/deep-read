Meeting summarization and quiz generator.

## Features

The following functionalities will be implemented for making online classes more effective:
- Use Artificial Intelligence (AI), to summarize the contents of video call/conference
	 - This will help students to focus more on the lecture.
 - Automatically generate Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from both the meeting transcript and visual media presented during the meeting
	 - This will help both the faculties and students to evaluate the understanding of the online lecture.
- Supply reverse search capability to search for a term from the video
	- This will help students to easily find a particular clip in the video.
